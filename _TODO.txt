3) Remote component 
4) OpenFin 




TODO 
- Micro front end 
  - Web component 
    - Fetch HTML, CSS, JS 
    - Try Shadow DOM 
  - Iframe 
    - Resize automatically 
- Proxy 
- GoldenLayout
  - Strip down demo 
  - Save/restore
  - Iframe component 
  - Separate widgets' CSS, JS 
  - Add to Simple SPA
  - React
  - Convert widgets to apps and iframe/fetch them 
  - Save/restore
- Settings menu 
- CSS - fit micro-apps to containers
- Fake login 
- Save/restore + websockets
  - Settings - save/restore
  - Settings - websockets
  - GoldenLayout - save/restore 
  - GoldenLayout - websockets
- GoldenLayout - way to add more window panes 
- Bugfix - fix pages 
- Bugfix - Micro-app is no longer working standalone 
- Propagate new props to mounted sub apps
- Bugfix - goldenLayout + web component is broken
- Bugfix - lazy component rerenders too often. Try only fetching when url changes 
- Bugfix - standalone Micro-app broken again
- Lazy-load - figure out how to load components from a URL
- Lots of small things 
  - Separate GoldenLayoutComponent vs MicroFrontendModeSwitch
  - Enum for modes 
  - Separate Lazy and Remote components 
  - React ShadowDOM npm package
  X- Declarative ShadowDOM browser tag (Not even close to standardized.)
  - CSS - clean up and use flexbox
  - Remove disableLiveReload
  - Lerna - don't use it for cross-linking packages b/c it fights against npm install 
  - Bugfix - iframes are not passing props down on mount
  X- Grid - fix when in ShadowDOM (Slickgrid inserts a style tag in head. I guess it's a good example of a lib that's not compatible with ShadowDom)
  - Bugfix - WS should have a windowId, so changes don't get sent to the window that made them
  - server and build 
    - live-server (Allows you to server a single-page-application more easily than 'http-server' or 'serve')
    - Webpack - split vendor into separate bundle
    - lerna - easily run all packages with 1 command at the same time
    - Can micro-components build and serve instead of build:dev
    X- Easy toggle dev vs serve dist

  - Definitions 
    - Definitions - micro-app, navigation 
    - Move table of contents to container?
  - Try more micro apps: create-react-app and Vue
- OpenFin / Electron
- Try other micro frontend approaches 
- More/Extras
  - Each app should save its own state 
  - More Features/framework - toasts, notifications, permissions, etc, etc, etc 
  - Middleware to send redux changes to WS?
  - Bugfix - GoldenLayout sometimes redraws to an old state if you make 2 changes in a row - consider removing Redux. Could make save/restore/reinit much simpler. Would need a way to listen to websocket without redux 
  - DefinitionsService - place to define featueres, their bootstrap script, menu items + their props, etc 
  - simulate dev - try using npm live-server for built code 
  - Types for all React props and state. Remove all "any"s.
  - Readme 
  - Prettier 
  - Better source maps
  - Webpack optimizations: https://webpack.js.org/configuration/optimization/
- Bonus points 
  - Remote component - try even more approaches
