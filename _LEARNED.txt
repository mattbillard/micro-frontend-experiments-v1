LEARNED PRE PROJECT 
- Webpack 
  - Guides and docs. Invaluable. 
  - Proxies. (Code Collider v1 and v2)


DURING PROJECT 
- Webpack 
  - Packaging React components with React as an "external" and then "alias"ed in 
  - umd vs commonjs 
  - Vendor bundles 
  - Multiple exports 
  - writeToDisk
  - Plugins: MiniCssExtractPlugin, CopyPlugin, CleanWebpackPlugin, MiniCssExtractPlugin
- Parcel 
  - Amazing, user-friendly, and fast... but not customizeable enough to allow for packaging React components. (Very sad)
- Micro frontend components 
  - ShadowDOM 
    - Great for CSS issolation. Doesn't work with all 3rd party libs (e.g. SlickGrid)
  - import() 
    - Dynamic and lazy but doesn't work with URLs
  - Iframes 
    - Updating an app with new props 
  - Remote components 
    - Currently no good library out there ready for use
    - Not difficult if you use a global var 
- live-server 
  - Great for serving dist folder as a SPA 
  - Using live-server instead of Webpack devServer is unbelievably faster
- lerna 
  - Better than npm run-all 
  - Not as easy as using "file:...." in package.json 
- Websockets
